# Robocorp level II certification course

The aim of this course is to build a robot on our own.
More information can be found [here](https://robocorp.com/docs/courses/build-a-robot).

I decided to build it using only Python.

- The whole logic of the tasks are included in the task.py file
- conda.yaml contains the required dependencies
- vault is used to store the URL of the robot site. It is not the appropiate way of using vault but it is used with demonstration purposes.
- There is an issue with the action in github. I hope I can manage solve it soon :)
