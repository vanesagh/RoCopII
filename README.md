# Robocorp level II certification course

The aim of this course is to build a robot on our own.
More information can be found [here](https://robocorp.com/docs/courses/build-a-robot).

I decided to build it using only Python.

- The whole logic of the tasks are included in the task.py file
- conda.yaml contains the required dependencies

## Learning materials

- [Python basics](https://robocorp.com/docs/languages-and-frameworks/python)
