# Robocorp level II certification course

The aim of this course is to build a robot on our own.
More information can be found [here](https://robocorp.com/docs/courses/build-a-robot).

I decided to build it using only Python.


- Uses only Python.
- Provides a simple template to start from (`task.py`).
